Aim: The aim of this process is to simulate a wireless communication link.  

Transmitter Structure and Tasks

For single-antenna system: 
‚Ä¢ Random information bit generation for an OFDM symbol size of 2048.
‚Ä¢ Mapping of the information bit sequence to Gray-coded 16-QAM 
constellation.
‚Ä¢ OFDM symbol generation without and with comb-interleaved pilots.
‚Ä¢ Cyclic prefix insertion: No CP, 16, 32, and 64 samples.
‚Ä¢ Loop for Monte Carlo simulation of the communication link that runs for at 
least 106 16-QAM symbols per signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) point.

For multi-antenna system: 
‚Ä¢ Simulation of the system directly in frequency domain.
‚Ä¢ Extend the transmitter to MIMO.
‚Ä¢ Simulation of 2 √ó 2, 2 √ó 5 and 2 √ó 10 MIMO systems.

Channel Specifications and Tasks

For single-antenna system, two different channels to be implemented:
‚Ä¢ AWGN: SNR = 0-16 dB in steps of 1 dB
‚Ä¢ Frequency selective multipath channel with impulse response h(n) and AWGN:
o ITU Pedestrian B, Channel 103.
o SNR: 0-40 dB in steps of 2 dB.
‚Ä¢ Perfect symbol timing is assumed.
Code to perform:
‚Ä¢ Computation of the theoretical standard deviation for the AWGN noise samples.
‚Ä¢ Frequency response of the multipath channel.
‚Ä¢ Channel filtering of the transmitted signal.

For multi-antenna system, the channels to be implemented:
‚Ä¢ Rayleigh channels (complex Gaussian coefficients) in the presence of AWGN.
‚Ä¢ Different Tx/Rx antenna combinations: 2 √ó 2, 2 √ó 5 and 2 √ó 10 MIMO systems.

Receiver Structure and Tasks for single-antenna system

FFT and 16-QAM demodulation using the minimum Euclidean distance approach.
‚Ä¢ Zero Forcing equalization with perfect channel knowledge.
‚Ä¢ ZF equalization with channel estimation using a comb distributed pilots, e.g. 1 
pilot for every 8 subcarriers.
‚Ä¢ Constellation plots at the output of the equalizer for specific SNR point, e.g. 5, 15 
and 25 dB.
‚Ä¢ Performance of mean square error (MSE) of channel estimation, ùëíùëÄùëÜùê∏ =
ùê∏{|ùêª ùëõ ‚àí ùêª‡∑°(ùëõ)|
2
}, vs. SNR for different cyclic prefix lengths and the two 
investigated multipath channels.
‚Ä¢ BER vs. SNR in dB for the 2 channels and 2 receivers.
‚Ä¢ For the AWGN channel no cyclic prefix is required.
‚Ä¢ For the multipath channel + AWGN the ZF and MMSE receiver must be evaluated 
with or without channel knowledge and for the different cyclic prefix lengths.

Receiver Structure and Tasks for multi-antenna system

ZF equalization with perfect channel knowledge.
‚Ä¢ MMSE equalization with perfect channel knowledge.
‚Ä¢ BER vs. SNR in dB for the Rayleigh channel in the presence of AWGN 
for the 2 receivers (ZF, MMSE) and different Tx/Rx antenna 
combinations, i.e. 2 √ó 2, 2 √ó 5 and 2 √ó 10.
‚Ä¢ For the AWGN channel select appropriate SNR range so that the 
performance is shown down to a BER range of 10^‚àí5.
